<u>Requirements</u>

2. WPMU Prosite (duh!)
3. Gravity Form User Registration plugin (only comes with developers edition)
4. Some time and patience

This plugin replaces the current prosite manual paymant process. It has 3 forms in-built:

So good luck and enjoy! If you have any questions - i'm contactable through wpmudev! Let me know if i should continue to update this!
